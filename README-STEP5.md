## Deployment Instructions

### Frontend Deployment

#### Option 1: Netlify
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
3. Deploy settings are auto-configured via netlify.toml
4. Update environment variable in Netlify dashboard:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = Your backend URL

#### Option 2: Vercel
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel

2. Create new Railway project
3. Deploy from GitHub repo (select backend folder)
4. Add environment variables:
   - Copy from .env.production
   - Update `CORS_ORIGIN` with frontend URL
   - Keep `USE_MOCK_DATA=true` for now

#### Alternative: Render
1. Create Web Service
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Build Command: `npm install`
4. Start Command: `node index.js`
5. Add environment variables
