### Step-by-Step Instructions:

- Click "New" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
- Railway will create a PostgreSQL instance

#### 2. Get Database URL:
- Click on PostgreSQL service
- Go to "Connect" tab
- Copy the `DATABASE_URL` (starts with postgresql://)

#### 3. Set up Database Schema:
```bash
cd scripts
npm install
node setup-production-db.js "YOUR_DATABASE_URL"
```

#### 4. Import Card Data:
```bash
node import-production-data.js "YOUR_DATABASE_URL"
```

This will import:
- 250 recent Standard format cards
- Competitive ratings for meta cards
- All attacks, abilities, and types

#### 5. Update Railway Backend Variables:
Add these to your backend service:
- `DB_HOST` (from PGHOST)
- `DB_PORT` (from PGPORT)
- `DB_NAME` (from PGDATABASE)
- `DB_USER` (from PGUSER)
- `DB_PASSWORD` (from PGPASSWORD)
- `USE_MOCK_DATA=false`
